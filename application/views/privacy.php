<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


Last Updated: June 28, 2011 | <a href=""><i>Download printable format (PDF)</i></a>

<p>
This privacy policy applies to all websites and web services operated by Mozilla Corporation or the Mozilla Foundation unless the website or service has a separate privacy policy. Since the Mozilla Corporation and the Mozilla Foundation individually operate these sites but share many of the same privacy practices, we will refer to them collectively as “Mozilla” in this policy when describing practices that apply to both of them.
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>



<p>The IBM Online Privacy Statement applies to IBM’s and our affiliates’ Web sites that link to the Statement. Below are some of the highlights of the Statement.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<div id="visiter">
<p>
	Except as described below, Mozilla does not collect or require visitors to its websites to furnish personally identifying information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Like most website operators, Mozilla does collect non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, operating system, language preference, referring site and date and time of each visitor request. Mozilla also collects potentially-personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users.
</p>
<p>
	Mozilla's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how Mozilla's visitors use its websites. To that end, Mozilla may share potentially-personally identifying information with its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations. Mozilla may also release its results of such analyses of non-personally identifying information about visitors by publishing a report on website usage trends. Otherwise, Mozilla will not publicly release potentially-personally identifying information except under the same circumstances as Mozilla releases personally identifying information. Those circumstances are explained below.
</p>

<h3>Children</h3>


<p>Mozilla's websites are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide personally identifying information through our websites.</p>


<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Mozilla undertakes a range of security measures including physical access restraints, technical security monitoring, and internal security reviews of the environment to help to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.   We also have policies in place to prohibit employees from viewing personal information without business justification.
</p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>


<p>We collect your personal information for various purposes, such as processing your order, corresponding with you, providing you with a subscription or in connection with a job application. We may combine the information we collect from you with information obtained from other sources to help us improve its overall accuracy and completeness, and to help us better tailor our interactions with you.
